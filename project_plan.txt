Later:
------
- Have changed ingredient amounts to strings; need to convert into Rationals (or something) when:
--- consolidating list at top of recipe show
--- calculating grocery list
--- Notes: parse string "1 2/3" either l/r or r/l, use space & slash to split, generate rational
- Errors partial
- Standardize unit inputs (autocomplete 'tsp, cup,' etc.)
- Select2 box for ingredient search
- Dropdown for tags (like postit app)
- Don't display "x.0" in ingredient amounts (unless there is an actual fraction)
- Math for combining ingredients into grocery list
- Generate grocery list
- Styling
- Improve nested form code?
- Validate user-input links in recipe form
- User accounts
- Account activation / password reset
- If no ingredient is included, add option to hide/remove input fields.  (Not essential, no error thrown if blank.)
- Add option to re-order steps
- Hide 'delete' check boxes on create form
- Add type to ingredients for grocery list (e.g. Dairy, Frozen, Produce, etc.)
- Check for different units in amount consolidation.
- Set default unit for ingredients as blank, if possible (remove 'piece(s)')

Done:
-----
- Store ingredient amounts as strings to support mixed numbers (1 1/3)
- Filter search results by tag
- Add tags to recipes
- Search by ingredient
- Show all ingredients at top of recipe (get from steps & condense if there are multiple instances of the same ingredient)
- Models & nested form for steps w/ingredients
